Hi!
My name is Young and I'm a machine learning and data science enthusiast that enjoys solving challenging problems with some combination of math, programming and sheer determination.

This site is an unorganized collection of my personal projects and notes, mostly for my own reference, but feel free to browse around and see if you find anything interesting.
