This is a project to produce a summary of a Korean text article, mainly intended for creating quick summary of news articles.

You can check out the [live demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/yhshin/kr-article-summarizer),
which lets you summarize custom input text or scrape the body of an article from a valid Naver News link.

(The demo can sometimes take 10-20 seconds to load so don't be alarmed if you see a blank page at first.)
