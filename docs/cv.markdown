# Experience details

## Combat Development Division, R.O.K. Army Intelligence School

### Enlisted military research personnel (05/2019 - 05/2020)

My main role was performing technical background research and developing research proposals for military-use LiDAR and electro-optical systems.
In this role, I carried out technical surveys and authored reports on state-of-the-art and novel LiDAR and electro-optical technologies and related computational imaging techniques, including single photon LiDAR, non-line-of-sight imaging, compressed sensing applications to high frame rate LiDAR, and more.
I was the main technical contributor to a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a high-altitude airborne single photon LiDAR system for use in the R.O.K. Army.

I also published a proposal in a R.O.K military technology journal for a low cost CubeSat-based satellite imaging system using 'photon sieves', a novel lightweight optical element that can perform the role of a large lens or focusing mirror.


## High Energy Physics Experiment Group, U of Maryland

### Graduate research assistant (05/2013 - 05/2018)

I worked as a member of the CMS particle detector collaboration located at CERN, Switzerland, one of the two detectors responsible for the discovery of the Higgs particle in 2011.
I performed a diverse set of challenging tasks related to physics analysis, detector operation, performance analysis and upgrade design and planning.

My main research role was to perform statistical analysis of LHC collision data collected by the CMS detector to search for signs of new physics phenomena that could explain the particle origin of dark matter.
In this role, I carried out multi-stage processing and analysis of collision data using a global distributed computing cluster operated by CERN. 
The main processing code was written in a C++ framework and the processing pipeline was configured in python.
Downstream analysis was performed in C++ and python at a local computing cluster operated by the HEP Experiment Group in University of Maryland.

I was also the main contributor to a 3D Monte Carlo simulation written in C++ and used for the modeling and analysis of light propagation and radiation damage in a major detector component.
Other operational tasks include analysis and modeling of a multivariate physics variable called 'MVA MET', experimental measurements and analysis of radiation damage in future detector components, and minor system administration tasks at the local computing cluster.


## Robotics study team - Trinity College (CT, US)

### Undergraduate research assistant (05/2009 - 06/2011)

My main role was design and programming of an autonomous ground navigation robot called 'Q', which competed in the annual IGVC competition.
As team co-leader, I was tasked with the design and implementation of a multi-sensor algorithm for autonomous navigation through an obstacle course.
I was the chief architect of the core system that integrated asynchronous data input/output from several sensors and actuators, including LiDAR, webcams, compass and motors.
I was also heavily involved in implementation and testing of an elementary Computer Vision algorithm that used two webcams for low-level obstacle detection.
